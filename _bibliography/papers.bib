abstract = { Self-organisation in robot swarms can produce collective behaviours, particularly through spatial self-organisation. For example, it can be used to ensure that the robots in a swarm move collectively. However, from a designer’s point of view, understanding precisely what happens in a swarm that allows these behaviours to emerge at the macroscopic level remains a difficult task. The same behaviour can come from multiple different controllers (ie the control algorithm of a robot) and a single controller can give rise to multiple different behaviours, sometimes caused by slight changes in self-organisation. To grasp the causes of these differences, it is necessary to investigate the relationships between the many methods of self-organisation that exist and the various behaviours that can be obtained. The work presented here addresses self-organisation in robot swarms by focusing on the main behaviours that lead to spatial self-organisation of the robots. First, we propose a unified definition of the different behaviours and present an original classification system highlighting ten self-organisation methods that each allow one or more behaviours to be performed. An analysis, based on this classification system, links the identified mechanisms with behaviours that could be considered as obtainable or not. Finally, we discuss some perspectives on this work, notably from the point of view of an operator or designer. }

abstract = {In the context of robot swarms, fragmentation refers to a breakdown in communication and coordination among the robots. This fragmentation can lead to issues in the swarm self-organisation, especially the loss of efficiency or an inability to perform their tasks. Human operators influencing the swarm could prevent fragmentation. To help them in this task, it is necessary to study the ability of humans to perceive and anticipate fragmentation. This article studies the perception of different types of fragmentation occurring in swarms depending on their behaviour selected amongst swarming, flocking, expansion and densification. Thus, we characterise human perception thanks to two metrics based on the distance separating fragmented groups and the separation speed. The experimentation protocol consists of a binary discrimination task in which participants have to assess the presence of fragmentation. The results show that detecting fragmentation for expansion behaviour and anticipating fragmentation, in general, are challenging. Moreover, they show that humans rely on separation distance and speed to infer the presence or absence of fragmentation. Our study paves the way for new research that will provide information to humans to better anticipate and efficiently prevent the occurrence of swarm fragmentation.},
